# Book4Book

B4B is a P2P book trading platform which allows users to trade their used books and search for books that they are interested in. 


## Problem Statement
For many book-lovers, book reading can become a very expensive hobby at times, where the price of books can go from 10 to up to 50 dollars per book. Furthermore, books that have been read once are rarely ever read again, and will just be placed on the book shelves for the rest of its life cycle. Thus, we wanted to solve this problem by creating a book-trading app that allows users to trade their currently-owned books with each other, drastically reducing the money spent on books and to lengthen the life-span of their books. By allowing users to upload their books they want to trade, browse through existing book listings, as well as to trade among each other through our chat function, we hope that book-reading can become a more inexpensive and environmentally sustainable hobby for everyone.
